Once the code is executed, the videos will be downloaded to the current working directory.

### Note:

- The Pytube library may not work with some videos due to YouTube's restrictions. In such cases, you can try using a different library or a third-party tool to download the video.
- Be sure to respect YouTube's terms of service and only download videos that you have permission to use.
- Downloading large playlists may take some time, so be patient while the notebook runs.
